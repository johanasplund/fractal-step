Fractal step
============

A small program for visualizing fractals.

Max Isacson

TODO
----
- Come up with a catchier name
- ~~Add color selection~~
- ~~Add option to set random color~~
- ~~Add option to set random color for each iteration~~ Implement this in a better way
- Add option to set background color maybe
- ~~Add exit button~~
- ~~Add pause button~~
- Add "make your own fractal" feature using L-systems
- Add manual stepping thingy
- Add options to set if the program should stop after last iteration, or start over with the first
- Add option to set time between iterations
- Add option to set time before starting over with the first iteration
- More stuff probably
- Fix bug where if the fractal is done with its last iteration, you can not close the drawing window, forcing you to quit the application
- Add option to make rainbow fractals (fetch the color from a given smooth curve in the RGB space)

Fractals to add
---------------

- Mandelbrot set
- Julia set
- Sierpinski gasket (L-system) ~~Using Pascals' triangle~~
- Fractal plant
- Cantor dust (maybe boring, but still a pretty fundamental fractal)
- Newton fractals
- Maybe some other cool stuff, like all roots of polynomials and such

Other cool stuff to add
-----------------------

- Computation of pi (Leibniz vs. Monte Carlo, etc.) ~~Buffon's needle~~
