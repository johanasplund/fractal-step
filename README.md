Fractal step
============

A small program for visualizing fractals.

Max Isacson

TODO
----
- Come up with a catchier name
- ~~Add color selection~~
- Add option to set random color
- Add option to set random color for each iteration
- Add optione to set background color maybe
- Add exit button
- Add pause button
- Add "make your own fractal" feature using L-systems
- Add manual stepping thingy
- Add options to set if the program should stop after last iteration, or start over with the first
- Add option to set time between iterations
- Add option to set time before starting over with the first iteration
- More stuff probably

Fractals to add
---------------

- Mandelbrot set
- Julia set
- Sierpinski gasket (could be both as an L-system and the normal one)
- Fractal plant
- Cantor dust (maybe boring, but still a pretty fundamental fractal)
- Maybe some other cool stuff, like all roots of polynomials and such
